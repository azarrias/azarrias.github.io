¡Hi!

Welcome, visitor.
My name is Adolfo Zarrias and I'm a software engineer from Barcelona (Spain), with quite a lot of experience as a programmer, analyst,
team lead and project manager.

My education comprises:
* Master in Game Design and Development @ Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (2017)
* Master of Science in Project Management @ La Salle (2013)
* Master's Degree in Computer Engineering @ Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (2009)

My main interests are videogames, music, films, tv shows, sports and programming in general.
The intent behind this humble blog is to use it as a professional portfolio, as well as to keep track of what I write
on these topics.

Some of my projects are hosted on my [Github profile](https://github.com/azarrias) and you can take a look at 
my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9Wb4mR-MKLhcVJ5RDRyNFJYd1U).

Make yourself comfortable. I hope you enjoy your stay! ;)
