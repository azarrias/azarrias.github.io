[Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) is a Jekyll 3.x theme based on [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde.
As soon as I saw [how it looked like](https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/), I wanted to use it for this portfolio. So, I decided to modify it in order to support multilingual use.
[This](https://github.com/azarrias/hydeout-multilingual) is its repository. And [this](https://azarrias.github.io/hydeout-multilingual) is how its template version looks like.

It's fairly easy to set up a blog using [Jekyll in combination with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).
I guess neither of them need an introduction, but Jekyll is an increasingly popular static site generator, while GitHub Pages is a great web hosting service offered by GitHub.

All in all, you get:
* An awesome site made just from plain text.
* One organization (or user) site plus infinite project sites.
* Version control.
* Support for markdown, liquid, HTML & CSS.
* Site builds automagically when pushing any change to the site repository on GitHub.
* A whole lot of themes that you can chose from to make your site look amazing.
* All of this for free.

I chose Hydeout as a Jekyll theme, because I wanted it to:
* Be light, simple and elegant
* Provide responsive design
* Be plug-in free

On top of that, it is easy to customize and provides support for Google Analytics and Disqus, among some other nice features.
