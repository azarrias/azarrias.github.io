Super Sparty Bros is a demo of a 2D platform game, where you need to collect a "victory" item in order to beat a certain level.
I did this as an assignment for the Michigan State University courses on Game Development.
This was the first time that I developed a cross-platform project for Unity.

Through this project I learned about some of the game engine's topics, such as: 
* Working with 2D sprites and physics
* Creating and controlling 2D animations
* Implementing typical 2D platformer mechanics
* Cross-platform input management
* Storing game state with Player Prefs
* Parallax scrolling
* Image effects (later on, I adapted them to use the new post processing stack)

It is possible to play with a WebGL build of this project [here](/assets/webgl/super-sparty-bros).
There are other builds available in the project's [repository](https://github.com/azarrias/super-sparty-bros).
