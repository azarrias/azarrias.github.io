Sci-Fi Tech Demo is an FPS-type demo that I used to experiment with lights, reflection probes, destructibles, etc. on a 3D setting.

You can move around and explore the market, collect a coin from the vending machine, buy a weapon with that coin and shoot and destroy the wooden crate. 
When the weapon is out of ammunition, you can reload by pressing R.
