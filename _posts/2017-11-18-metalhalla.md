Metalhalla is a 2.5D "metroidvania" viking themed action platformer.

It was created by a team of four engineers as a capstone project during our Master in Game Design and Development that we took at the UPC School, in Barcelona.
My tasks on the project comprised programming, sound design and sound engineering.
The game engine that we used is Unity.
