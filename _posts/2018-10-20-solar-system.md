This is one of the first projects that I did with Unity around 2016, a solar system simulation of sorts.
It was an exercise for the Michigan State University courses on Game Development.
When you click on a planet on the main scene or on the minimap, the main camera will follow it.

Through this project I learned about some of the game engine's topics, such as: 
* Creating materials
* Working with an additional camera to create a minimap
* Basic audio topics
* Basic lighting
* Make camera follow game objects

I didn't try to make this project realistic in any way:
Orbits would be difficult to model accurately, and we would see only a humongous sun if
the proportions and distances between the different planets were close to reality.

It is possible to play with a WebGL build of this project [here](/assets/webgl/solar-system).

You can click on any planet for the camera to follow its trajectory.
