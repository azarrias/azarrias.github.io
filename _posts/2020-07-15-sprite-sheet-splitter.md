Sprite Sheet Splitter is a extremely simple tool that can be used to quickly splitting sprite sheets and preview animations.
It can be specially useful when dealing with irregular sprite sheets.

How to use:
* Once you open the application, you will be prompt to browse and open the desired sprite sheet.
* You can modify the "slicing parameters" until you are satisfied with your selection.
* When clicking slice, the selected sprites / frames will be given a number.
* You can then preview an animation by double clicking the frames in the desired order.
* The interval between frames is given in seconds, and can be modified.
* All these changes will be reflected on the fly.
* It's also possible to zoom in and out using the mouse wheel.
