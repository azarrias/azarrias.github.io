Sprite Sheet Splitter is an extremely simple tool that can be used to quickly split sprite sheets and preview animations.
It can be specially useful when dealing with irregular sprite sheets.

How to use:
* Once you open the application, you will be prompt to browse and open the desired sprite sheet.
* You can modify the "slicing parameters" until you are satisfied with your selection.
* When clicking slice, the selected sprites / frames will be given a number.
* You can then preview an animation by double clicking the frames in the desired order.
* The interval between frames is given in seconds, and can be modified.
* All these changes will be reflected on the fly.
* It's also possible to zoom in and out using the mouse wheel.
