Galaxy Shooter is a 2D arcade scrolling shooter demo. 
You control a ship and get points from destroying enemy ships. 
You can also collect power-ups that improve your plane for a limited time. 
The demo goes on forever until you lose all your lives.

I'd like to switch from vertical scrolling to horizontal, which I think is better suitable.
Also I must fix z-fighting between the shield and the ship thrusters, as well as some sprite transparency issues during explosions.
