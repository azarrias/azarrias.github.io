Demo of Suicide Note, 2D horizontally scrolling shooter in the making, on which a whole note faces various threats while travelling through sound to the rhythm of music.

<!--more-->

The player character which is a whole note, can dash and shoot enemies in the direction of the mouse pointer (or last tap on mobile) to the rhythm of music.
Dashing happens on kick drum sounds, while shooting actions take place on snare drum hits.
