Box Shooter is a demo of a 3D game on which you control a laser rifle. 
There are three types of spawning cubes in terms of their color:
* Green: they give you points
* White: they give you extra playing time
* Orange: they decrease your remaining time

I did this as an assignment for the Michigan State University courses on Game Development.
It is possible to play with a WebGL build of this project [here](/assets/webgl/box-shooter).

## Controls
This game can be played by moving the mouse for aiming and clicking left mouse button for shooting.
