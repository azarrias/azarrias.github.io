Roller Madness is a demo of a 3D game on which you control a roller ball. 
Coins and enemies continously spawn on the playing field (hence the word madness).
There is no actual way to beat the game, so it is just a matter of picking up as many coins as you can while surviving as long as you can.

I did this as an assignment for the Michigan State University courses on Game Development.

Through this project I learned about some of the game engine's topics, such as: 
* Using the standard assets packages
* Physics
* User interface basics
* Trail renderers
* Particle systems
* Animation

It is possible to play with a WebGL build of this project [here](/assets/webgl/roller-madness).

## Controls
This game can be played with the arrow keys.
