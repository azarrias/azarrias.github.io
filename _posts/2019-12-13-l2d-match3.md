Match 3 is a tile-matching video game where the player must manipulate tiles in order to make them disappear while creating matches.
Matches are created when combining three or more tiles with the same color on a row or column.

Tiles can be reordered by switching their location, but only if they are adjacent on the board.
Levels are generated randomly with increasing difficulty.
If the board has no available moves at one point, it will be automatically reordered.
