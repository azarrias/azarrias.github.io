Hello there!

Welcome to my personal blog (and portfolio!).

This blog has been built on [Hydeout](https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/), a theme for Jekyll that I adapted for [multilingual use](https://github.com/azarrias/hydeout-multilingual) 
(notice the language selector on the sidebar).

It's really easy to set up a blog using [Jekyll in combination with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).
I guess neither of them need an introduction, but Jekyll is an increasingly popular static site generator, while GitHub Pages is a great web hosting service offered by GitHub.

All in all, you get:
* An awesome site made just from plain text.
* One organization (or user) site plus infinite project sites.
* Version control.
* Support for markdown, liquid, HTML & CSS.
* Site builds automagically when pushing any change to the site repository on GitHub.
* A whole lot of themes that you can chose from to make your site look amazing.
* All of this for free.

I chose Hydeout as a Jekyll theme, because I wanted it to:
* Be light, simple and elegant
* Provide responsive design
* Be plug-in free

On top of that, it is easy to customize and provides support for Google Analytics and Disqus, among some other nice features.
