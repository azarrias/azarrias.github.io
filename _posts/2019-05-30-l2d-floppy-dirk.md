Floppy Dirk is a clone of the side-scroller game Flappy Bird, on which the player controls a bird.
The goal of the game is to go as far away as possible while flying between columns of green pipes without colliding against them.

<!--more-->

The pipes are randomly generated infinitely, until the player eventually dies when hitting any of them.
