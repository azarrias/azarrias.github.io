This is probably the first project that I ever did with Unity, a solar system simulation (well, sort of!).
Anyhow, it displays all solar system planets moving around the screen.

I did it as an exercise for the Michigan State University courses on Game Development.

Through this project I learned about some of the game engine's topics, such as: 
* Creating materials
* Working with an additional camera to create a minimap
* Basic audio topics
* Basic lighting
* Make camera follow game objects

I didn't try to make this project realistic in any way, so it does not try to be a simulation actually:
Orbits would be difficult to model accurately, and we would see only a humongous sun if
the proportions and distances between the different planets were close to reality.

It is possible to play with a WebGL build of this project [here](/assets/webgl/solar-system).

## Controls
You can click on any planet, on the main scene or on the minimap, for the camera to follow its trajectory.
