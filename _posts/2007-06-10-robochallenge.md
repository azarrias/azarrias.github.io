Robochallenge was a robotics and computer vision competition, that took place in the Netherlands.
It was a nationwide competition on which participants from different universities showcased their skills on the aforementioned fields of study.

I feel very lucky that I had the opportunity to be one of these participants, as a part of my capstone project (which was recognized with distinction).

It was my first experience abroad and it certainly had a huge impact on my life.

On top of that our entity, Noordelijke Hogeschool Leeuwarden, won the competition. 
What more can you ask for?

Here's a [short tv report](https://youtu.be/1cwcCpa2jis) about the event.
